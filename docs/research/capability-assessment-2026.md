# rusty_term Capability Assessment — 2026

A capability audit of rusty_term against the 2026 terminal landscape: kitty,
Ghostty, WezTerm, Alacritty, Windows Terminal, Konsole/VTE, iTerm2, Contour,
and Warp. 28 items evaluated — 27 recommended, 1 explicitly considered and
rejected.

**Status:** implementation follows the suggested sequencing. Done items are
marked ✅ below and in the summary table; each carries a `Status: done` line
under its own heading naming the commit/PR.

## How this was built

rusty_term's own capability docs
([`terminal-stack-spec-tree.html`](terminal-stack-spec-tree.html),
[`../FEATURES.md`](../FEATURES.md),
[`implementation-status.md`](implementation-status.md)) were read in full and
cross-checked against the source for protocols competitor terminals have
adopted since those docs were last updated — synchronized output, undercurl,
the Kitty keyboard protocol, OSC 22, title stack, DECRQM, window
transparency, and others. Where a capability wasn't mentioned in rusty_term's
own gap-tracking at all, it's flagged below as a **silent gap** — something
competitive pressure will surface before the roadmap does.

Adoption claims are sourced from current (2026) terminal documentation and
comparison writeups, not training-data recall; see [Sources](#sources). This
is the **entire candidate pool** evaluated, including items dropped from an
initial top-20 cut for being out of scope, too diffuse to size honestly, or —
in one case — investigated and rejected outright.

## Tier 1 — Protocol fidelity, broad adoption, contained scope

The highest-value tier: each item is a self-contained parser/render
addition (no architectural change), and each is now supported by enough of
the field that its absence reads as a compatibility bug rather than a
missing extra.

### C01 — Synchronized output (DEC private mode 2026)
**Status: done.** `Grid::set_sync_output`/`sync_output_active` (`src/core/grid.rs`),
wired in the parser's DECSET/DECRST handler and gating the render-trigger
call sites in `src/runtime/tokio_rt.rs` (both Unix and Windows) and
`src/gui/window.rs`'s `Redraw` handler. Includes the timeout safety valve.

**Current (before).** No matches anywhere in `src/`. The grid renders whatever
partial state exists mid-update in both TUI passthrough and native GUI mode
— full-screen apps (vim, htop, tig) doing a fast multi-line redraw can show
visible tearing.

**Target.** Honor `CSI ?2026h` / `CSI ?2026l`: buffer grid mutations between
the two and defer the render-loop's "publish to renderer" step until the
closing sequence (with a timeout safety valve so a misbehaving app that
never closes can't freeze the display permanently).

**Why it matters.** `kitty` · `Ghostty (since 1.0)` · `Windows Terminal
1.24` · `Alacritty (dev)` · 14/44 tracked terminals as of April 2026. This
has crossed from "nice to have" to assumed baseline for a terminal that
claims not to flicker.

**Size** M · **Deps** none.

### C02 — Undercurl + colored underlines (SGR 4:3, 58/59)
**Status: done.** `UnderlineStyle` + `ATTR_UNDERLINE_COLOR` (`src/core/cell.rs`)
pack style and a colored-underline flag alongside the existing attribute
bits; `underline_color` is a new field on both `Cell` and `Pen`. The parser's
`parse_sgr_params` (`src/core/parser.rs`) distinguishes the ECMA-48 colon
sub-parameter form (`4:3`, one code) from the semicolon form (`4;3`, two
independent codes) via a synthetic sentinel, so the two are never confused;
SGR 58/59 reuse the existing `Palette::extended` truecolor/256-color decoder,
so both `58;2;r;g;b` and the colon `58:2:r:g:b` form work identically. The
CPU rasterizer (`src/gui/cpu.rs`) draws straight/double/curly/dotted/dashed
strokes and strikethrough as pixel stripes — a new decoration pass, since
neither was drawn anywhere before (the existing "underline" code there is
the DECSCUSR *cursor* shape, unrelated). The GPU renderer (`src/gui/gpu.rs`)
gets the same five styles + strikethrough drawn directly in the WGSL
fragment shader via two new per-instance fields, so the two render paths
stay at parity. TUI passthrough mode re-emits the style/color via `sgr_for`
(`src/render.rs`) so a capable host terminal renders the same thing.

**Current (before).** `ATTR_UNDERLINE` is a single boolean bit; no curly/dashed/
dotted underline styles and no separate underline-color channel. No matches
for SGR 58/59 anywhere in `src/`.

**Target.** Parse SGR `4:1`–`4:5` (straight/double/curly/dotted/dashed) and
`58`/`59` (underline color, 256 or truecolor), store per-cell alongside the
existing attribute bits, render curly as a distinct sine-wave stroke.

**Why it matters.** `kitty (originated)` · `VTE/GNOME Terminal` ·
`Alacritty` · `Konsole` · `iTerm2` · `xterm.js`. Neovim's built-in LSP
diagnostics assume this. rusty_term's whole shell-integration angle (OSC
133, the L13 side-channel) targets exactly the power users who run Neovim +
LSP daily — shipping without undercurl means squiggly-underline diagnostics
silently degrade to plain underlines.

**Size** M · **Deps** none.

### C03 — Kitty keyboard protocol (native GUI backend)
**Status: partially done.** `Grid::kitty_flags_stack` (`src/core/grid.rs`)
implements the full push/pop/set/query state machine (`CSI > flags u` /
`CSI < n u` / `CSI = flags ; mode u` / `CSI ? u`), applied from
`handle_private_csi` (`src/core/parser.rs`) alongside the existing host
relay. `gui/input.rs`'s key encoder reads the current flags and, when bit 1
(disambiguate escape codes) is set, encodes Escape/Enter/Tab/Backspace and
Ctrl+letter combinations as `CSI u` instead of their legacy (ambiguous)
bytes — covering the enhancement level the overwhelming majority of clients
actually request (Neovim's default `kitty_keyboard_protocol`, etc.). Bits 2/4/16
(event-type, alternate-key, and associated-text reporting) are **not**
implemented: they need release/repeat key events and IME-layout data that
aren't plumbed through the native window's input path today, and a client
that requests them gets the disambiguated-but-legacy-shaped encoding rather
than a fabricated answer. Widening this further is future work, tracked as
a known gap rather than silently claimed.

**Current (before).** TUI mode correctly *relays* the Kitty keyboard protocol and
xterm `modifyOtherKeys` to the host terminal (`src/core/parser.rs`,
`handle_private_csi`) — appropriate, since TUI mode is a passthrough. But
`src/gui/input.rs`'s own native key encoding has no progressive-enhancement
support: no enhancement-flag stack, no `CSI u` disambiguation, no
press/repeat/release event-type reporting.

**Target.** Implement the push/pop enhancement-flag stack and `CSI u`
encoding in `gui/input.rs`, so a standalone rusty_term window is a
first-class Kitty-keyboard-protocol terminal in its own right, not only when
relaying through a host that already speaks it.

**Why it matters.** `kitty` · `foot` · `WezTerm` · `Ghostty` · `Alacritty` ·
`iTerm2` · `VS Code terminal` · `Warp` · `Windows Terminal (preview)`.
Client-side adoption is just as broad — Neovim, Vim, Helix, fish, and
nushell all detect and use it. Without it, the native GUI window can't
distinguish Shift+Enter from Enter or report key-release, which several TUI
apps use for hold-to-repeat behavior.

**Size** M–L · **Deps** `gui` feature.

### C04 — OSC 22 (mouse pointer/cursor shape)
**Status: done.** `Grid::cursor_icon` (`src/core/grid.rs`), set by `osc.rs`'s
OSC 22 handler, mapped from CSS `cursor` keywords to `winit::CursorIcon` by
`parse_cursor_icon` and applied in the `CursorMoved` handler
(`src/gui/window.rs`) whenever the pointer is over pane content.

**Current (before).** No matches anywhere in `src/`.

**Target.** Let the child set the OS mouse cursor icon over the window
(e.g. an editor requesting an I-beam instead of a pointer) via OSC 22; map
the requested shape onto winit's `CursorIcon` — already wired for the
resize-border hover in `gui/window.rs`, so this is mostly new OSC parsing,
not new rendering machinery.

**Why it matters.** `xterm` · `kitty`. Small and cheap relative to its
payoff — the plumbing to change the cursor already exists in the codebase.

**Size** S · **Deps** `gui` feature.

### C05 — Window title stack (XTPUSHTITLE / XTPOPTITLE)
**Status: done.** `Grid::push_title`/`pop_title` (`src/core/grid.rs`), bounded
by `TITLE_STACK_MAX`, dispatched from the parser's `CSI t` handler
(`src/core/parser.rs`) on sub-params 22/23.

**Current (before).** No matches for `CSI 22t` / `CSI 23t`; `window.rs` only ever
reads the latest `g.title`, with no memory of what it was before.

**Target.** A small stack on `Grid`, pushed on `CSI 22;0/1/2t` and popped on
`CSI 23;0/1/2t`, so an app that sets a working title (vim, tmux) restores
the caller's title on exit instead of leaving a stale one in the window.

**Why it matters.** `xterm` · `VTE`. Standard xterm behavior many
full-screen apps rely on without checking for support first; without it,
quitting vim can leave the window titled "vim" indefinitely.

**Size** S · **Deps** none — core-side; surfaces through the existing
title-fallback path from the `--title` work.

### C06 — DECRQM (mode query/report)
**Status: done.** `AnsiParser::report_dec_mode`/`report_ansi_mode`
(`src/core/parser.rs`) answer `CSI ? Ps $p` (DEC private) and `CSI Ps $p`
(ANSI) with a DECRPM report for every mode rusty_term actually tracks state
for (DECOM, DECAWM, DECTCEM, alt-screen, mouse tracking + extended
encodings, bracketed paste, synchronized output C01, IRM); a mode we only
relay to the host and don't track ourselves (DECCKM, focus reporting)
answers "not recognized" (`0`) honestly rather than guessing, and so does
any genuinely unimplemented mode (e.g. LNM, until C22).

**Current (before).** rusty_term accepts DECSET/DECRST (mode-setting) but has no
matches for answering `CSI Ps $p` ("is mode *N* currently set?") queries at
all.

**Target.** Track a canonical table of every mode rusty_term supports and
reply `1` (set), `2` (reset), `3` (permanently set), or `4` (permanently
reset) as appropriate; unknown modes report `0`.

**Why it matters.** `xterm` · `kitty`. Well-behaved TUI libraries probe
capability via DECRQM before relying on a mode — including synchronized
output (C01) and bracketed paste — instead of assuming support and hoping.

**Size** S–M · **Deps** best done after C01, so there's a
synchronized-output state worth reporting.

### C07 — XTWINOPS pixel-size queries (CSI 14t / 16t / 18t)
**Status: done.** `Grid::cell_px` (`src/core/grid.rs`), set by the GUI
backend at pane creation and on every font rebuild (`src/gui/window.rs`);
`18t` (always answerable from `cols`/`rows`) works in TUI mode too, `14t`/`16t`
decline gracefully when `cell_px` is `None` (TUI, or before the first frame).

**Current (before).** No matches for the `CSI t` window-manipulation family. Apps
that need to size an image precisely have no way to ask "how many pixels is
one cell?"

**Target.** Answer `16t` (cell size in pixels) and `18t` (text-area size in
cells) using the GUI backend's known `cell_w`/`cell_h`; `14t` (text-area
size in pixels) follows directly from the two.

**Why it matters.** `xterm` · `kitty` · `WezTerm`. Directly relevant to a
terminal that already invested in pixel-perfect graphics: without this
query, an app placing a Sixel or Kitty image has to guess cell dimensions
instead of computing them.

**Size** S · **Deps** `gui` feature (needs real pixel dimensions; TUI mode
can report best-effort or decline).

---

## Tier 2 — GPU / native-GUI backend parity

Not competitive gaps so much as internal ones — every item here is already
named in rusty_term's own docs as a known shortfall of one render/input/
protocol path relative to another. Listed for completeness since a
capability audit that only looked outward would miss them.

### C08 — GPU renderer: no ligature shaping
**Current.** `docs/FEATURES.md` #11 states outright: "the GPU renderer
keeps per-cell glyphs (no ligatures)." The CPU renderer's hand-rolled GSUB
shaper (`gui/shape.rs`) has no GPU-path counterpart.

**Target.** Run the same shaping pass before building the GPU glyph-atlas
instance list — or, if the multi-cell-quad pipeline this depends on stays
deprioritized, downgrade the marketing claim so `--gpu` doesn't silently
look feature-complete.

**Why it matters.** A user who picks `--features gui-gpu` for performance
shouldn't have to know they've traded away a feature the CPU path has for
free. About the two render paths agreeing with each other, not catching up
to a competitor.

**Size** L · **Deps** `gui-gpu` feature; blocked on the GPU multi-cell-quad
pipeline already flagged as an open item in `implementation-status.md`.

### C09 — GPU renderer: no pixel image compositing
**Current.** Only the CPU renderer composites pixel-perfect Sixel/Kitty/
iTerm2 images; both the GPU renderer and TUI mode fall back to half-block
approximation.

**Target.** A texture-upload path for the GPU renderer mirroring the CPU
compositor's per-image placement and scroll-eviction logic
(`Grid::render_image`, `evict_scrolled_images`).

**Why it matters.** Same rationale as C08 — GPU-path users get a visibly
worse experience for one of rusty_term's headline investments.

**Size** L · **Deps** `gui-gpu` feature.

### C10 — Native GUI: mouse motion reporting + right/middle buttons
**Status: done.** `gui/mouse.rs`'s `MouseEvent`/`SgrEncoder` gained a
`MouseButtonKind` (left/middle/right) and a `Move { dragging }` event kind;
`window.rs` now matches all three `winit::MouseButton`s (not just `Left`) and
reports `CursorMoved` through the encoder — `?1000` stays click-only, `?1002`
reports motion only while a button is held, `?1003` reports every motion
(idle hover uses xterm's "no button" motion code, a held button reports its
number).

**Current (before).** `docs/FEATURES.md` #2 explicitly flags this as "not yet": the
native GUI backend reports click/release/scroll but not
motion-while-button-held (`?1002`) or all-motion (`?1003`), and doesn't
report right/middle clicks.

**Target.** Wire motion tracking and the missing buttons into
`gui/mouse.rs`'s existing SGR/1006 encoder.

**Why it matters.** Drag-to-resize panes inside tmux, mouse-driven TUI file
managers, and Neovim mouse mode all depend on motion reporting.

**Size** M · **Deps** `gui` feature.

### C11 — Native GUI: DECCKM application-cursor tracking
**Status: done.** `Grid::app_cursor_keys` (`src/core/grid.rs`), set from
`handle_private_csi` on DEC mode `1` alongside the existing host relay;
`window.rs` reads it from the focused pane's grid on every key press instead
of a hardcoded `false`.

**Current (before).** `implementation-status.md` flags that `gui/input.rs`'s key
encoding hardcodes `app_cursor=false` rather than tracking the mode the
running app actually set.

**Target.** Thread the parser's DECCKM state through to the key encoder so
arrow keys encode as `CSI` vs `SS3` correctly inside apps that toggle
application-cursor mode (vim, less).

**Why it matters.** Without it, cursor-key behavior can silently diverge
from what the app expects, natively-GUI-mode-only.

**Size** S · **Deps** `gui` feature.

### C12 — iTerm2 protocol: geometry hints + additional formats
**Status: geometry hints done; GIF/WebP/progressive-JPEG deferred.**
`Grid::render_image_sized` (`src/core/grid.rs`) generalizes the existing
auto-fit `render_image` to accept explicit `target_cols`/`target_rows` and a
`preserve_aspect` flag, "contain"-fitting within both when both are given
and aspect is preserved, stretching to fill both exactly when it isn't.
`core/iterm.rs`'s `resolve_dimension` parses each of iTerm2's `width=`/
`height=` forms (bare cell count, `N%` of the terminal's current columns/
rows, `Npx` converted via `Grid::cell_px` — `None` and left unresolved in
TUI mode, which has no real pixel size to convert against — and `auto`) and
`preserveAspectRatio=0/1`, wired through OSC 1337's `File=` handler.
GIF/WebP/progressive-JPEG decode is **not** implemented: tracing through
what each actually needs — animated GIF wants a frame-timer this
synchronous decode-and-place path has nowhere to hook into; WebP (lossy or
lossless) is a materially bigger from-scratch decoder than PNG/JPEG were,
on par with a second image codec project rather than a wave item;
progressive JPEG needs multi-scan coefficient accumulation the current
single-scan baseline decoder isn't structured for — showed each is its own
project-sized effort, not a shared afternoon's work the way the three were
bundled in the original sizing. Left for dedicated future items rather than
rushed.

**Current.** `docs/FEATURES.md` #14 notes that OSC 1337's
`width`/`height`/`preserveAspectRatio` geometry hints go unhonored, and that
only PNG + baseline JPEG decode (via the from-scratch `core/{iterm,jpeg}.rs`
stack) — no GIF, no WebP, no progressive JPEG.

**Target.** Honor the geometry parameters when placing an image; add GIF
(static frame) and WebP decoding, and progressive JPEG support.

**Why it matters.** rusty_term's iTerm2 support is otherwise complete and
genuinely differentiated (a from-scratch decoder, no image crates); these
are the specific documented edges left short of full protocol compliance.

**Size** M for the geometry hints (done); GIF/WebP/progressive-JPEG each
revised to roughly **L** on their own once actually scoped · **Deps** none
beyond the existing `core/iterm.rs`, `core/jpeg.rs`.

---

## Tier 3 — Window & rendering features

Architectural rather than protocol work — both items touch the window/App
model in `gui/window.rs`, not just the parser.

### C13 — Multiple top-level OS windows
**Status: assessed, deferred — see the note at the end of this document.**
Investigating the actual change confirmed the original sizing was
optimistic: `src/gui/window.rs` is a 2,270+ line `ApplicationHandler` impl
built entirely around one implicit window — `window_event`'s own `WindowId`
parameter is prefixed `_id` (unused) because every one of ~80 references to
`self.window`/`self.tabs`/`self.active`/`self.renderer` (and everything
downstream: mouse hit-testing, IME, clipboard, chrome hit-testing, resize,
drag-resize, every keybind) assumes a single window's worth of state.
Supporting a second independent window means either keying all of that
behind a `HashMap<WindowId, …>` or splitting `App` into a shared-backend
part and a per-window part threaded through every method — a rewrite of the
file's core data model, not an additive feature. Attempting it in the time
budget of one wave risks regressing mouse/keyboard/IME/resize handling that
currently works and is well covered by tests, for a feature I have no
windowing environment here to verify end-to-end. Left for a dedicated pass
with its own design + review, same call as C08/C09's GPU pipeline gap.

**Current.** The `App` struct holds a single `window: Option<Arc<Window>>`
and one `winit::EventLoop`; the model is one OS window with tabs and splits
inside it. There's no "open a second independent window" action.

**Target.** Support spawning an additional top-level window — either
drag-a-tab-out or a plain "new window" shortcut — sharing the backend and
config but owning its own tab set.

**Why it matters.** `kitty` · `WezTerm` · `Ghostty` · `Alacritty`. Every
major GUI competitor supports independent windows.

**Size** M, revised to **L** after the investigation above · **Deps** `gui`
feature; touches the winit `ApplicationHandler` lifecycle, the largest
architectural change among the recommended items.

### C14 — Background opacity + blur
**Status: partially done — GPU renderer only, blur deferred.** A `[window]
opacity` config key and `--opacity` CLI flag (`src/config.rs`, `src/main.rs`)
set `Config::opacity` (`0.0`-`1.0`); the windowed front-end requests a
transparent surface (`WindowAttributes::with_transparent`) when it's below
`1.0`. `GpuCore` (`src/gui/gpu.rs`) negotiates `CompositeAlphaMode::
PostMultiplied` from the surface's actual capabilities when offered, and its
WGSL fragment shader scales every pixel's alpha by the configured opacity
uniformly (cursor and underline/strike stripes included) — validated by
parsing+validating the shader with `naga` (no GPU adapter in this sandbox to
render-test against, so the real on-screen compositing couldn't be visually
confirmed). Deliberately **not** `PreMultiplied`: the shader doesn't
premultiply RGB, so picking that mode would composite wrong (a bright halo)
rather than just staying opaque, so `Opaque` is the fallback instead — a
correctness choice over a broader-but-wrong one. Two things are explicitly
**not** done: the CPU (`softbuffer`) renderer stays fully opaque regardless
of the setting — `softbuffer` 0.4's buffer format has no alpha channel
anywhere in its source (confirmed by inspection), so this isn't a bolt-on,
it needs a different presentation path entirely; and platform blur (macOS
`NSVisualEffectView`, KDE's blur-behind X11 property) isn't implemented at
all — it needs unsafe platform-specific FFI outside winit's cross-platform
surface, on platforms this sandbox has no way to build or test against, so
writing it blind was judged too likely to be subtly wrong (or to just not
compile on the target OS) to be worth shipping unverified.

**Current.** Both renderers paint fully opaque; no config key or CLI flag
for window transparency exists.

**Target.** A `[window] opacity` config key composited at the
window-surface level (not per-cell), plus platform blur where the OS
exposes it (macOS, KDE) as a best-effort extra.

**Why it matters.** `kitty` · `WezTerm` · `Alacritty` · `Ghostty`.
Universal among current GUI terminals.

**Size** M · **Deps** `gui` feature; softbuffer's opaque-only presentation
path needs a compositing change, wgpu's alpha blending is more direct.

---

## Tier 4 — Protocol & shell-integration extensions

Natural extensions of ground rusty_term already covers well — OSC 133 and
the L13 side-channel both suggest immediate next moves.

### C15 — OSC 633 (VS Code shell-integration superset)
**Status: done.** `src/core/osc.rs`'s `"633"` case shares the exact same
`A`/`C`/`D` command-lifecycle handling as `"133"` (factored into
`mark_command_lifecycle`), plus 633's `P;Cwd=<path>` property report, which
mirrors OSC 7's cwd tracking. Other 633 subcommands (command-line text
report, `IsWindows` hint, …) are recognized as well-formed and ignored, same
as 133's untracked `B`.

**Current (before).** rusty_term implements OSC 133 (prompt marks, command
lifecycle, scrollback nav) in full. OSC 633 is explicitly named as an open
item in the repo's own docs ("Still open (intentional long-tail): OSC
633").

**Target.** Extend the existing OSC 133 handler to also accept the 633
command family, reusing the prompt-mark infrastructure already in place.

**Why it matters.** `VS Code integrated terminal`. VS Code's terminal is the
de facto reference implementation many shell-integration scripts target
first.

**Size** S–M · **Deps** builds directly on the existing OSC 133
implementation in `src/core/osc.rs`.

### C16 — Alternate scroll mode (DEC private mode 1007)
**Status: done.** `Grid::alt_scroll` (`src/core/grid.rs`) tracks the mode
alongside the existing host relay; `window.rs`'s wheel handler checks it
(after mouse-tracking reporting, which still wins if the app also enabled
it) and, when on and the alternate screen is active, sends repeated
DECCKM-aware Up/Down key presses instead of browsing rusty_term's own
scrollback.

**Current (before).** No matches found. Mouse-wheel scroll always maps to
scrollback navigation; there's no translation to arrow-key presses inside
the alternate screen.

**Target.** When mode 1007 is set and the alt screen is active, translate
wheel events to Up/Down (or Page Up/Down) key sequences, matching xterm's
behavior.

**Why it matters.** `xterm` · `Alacritty` · `kitty`. Lets the mouse wheel
navigate `less`, `man`, and other pagers that never registered native mouse
support.

**Size** S · **Deps** none — small, self-contained.

### C17 — Command-output folding via OSC 133 marks
**Status: partially done — data model landed, render-path integration
deferred.** `Grid::fold_blocks`/`fold_output_begin`/`fold_output_end`/
`toggle_fold_at` (`src/core/grid.rs`) track each finished command's output
as a `CommandBlock { start, end, folded }` range in absolute logical lines,
independent of the `l13` feature's own (separately anchored) capture. The
range correctly shifts and drops blocks across scrollback eviction and rides
a resize reflow the same way prompt marks do (`reflow_history` now remaps
fold state too) — verified by dedicated tests, including one that resizes a
grid with an open fold block. What's **not** done: actually collapsing a
folded block's rows to one summary line on screen. Tracing through this
revealed the real scope is bigger than "S–M": `viewport_cell` and
`snapshot_viewport` (`src/core/grid.rs`) use a strict, uniform row↔logical-
line mapping that selection, search, and click-hit-testing (`cell_in_focused`
in `src/gui/window.rs`) all also key off directly. Making folded rows
disappear from that mapping without silently breaking those — which are
well-tested, currently-correct subsystems — needs a dedicated pass through
all of them, not a bolt-on. Rather than risk a rushed, partially-correct
integration, the toggle API and data model are shipped now (real,
independently useful, thoroughly tested infrastructure) and the rendering
consumer is left as clearly-scoped future work.

**Current (before).** rusty_term already tracks prompt starts (OSC 133;A) and
command boundaries (133;C/D) for scrollback navigation, but doesn't use
those marks for anything beyond jumping between them.

**Target.** Let a finished command's output collapse to one line in
scrollback (click or keybind to expand) — a scoped, achievable slice of
what Warp calls "command blocks," built on marks rusty_term already has.

**Why it matters.** `Warp (full block model, much larger scope)`. Genuinely
differentiating without committing to Warp's whole reimagining of the
terminal as a structured log.

**Size** M, revised to **M–L** once the render-path scope above came into
focus · **Deps** `gui` feature (folding is a rendering/interaction concept;
TUI passthrough has no natural place to put a fold toggle).

## Tier 5 — Forward-looking: watch, don't build yet

Real protocols with real adoption, but both are young enough that building
today risks targeting the wrong final shape. Included so they're on the
radar, not the backlog.

### C18 — Unicode width mode (DEC private mode 2027)
**Current.** rusty_term already does real UAX #29 grapheme clustering
(`unicode-segmentation`); mode 2027 would let an app explicitly opt in/out
of that behavior per-session.

**Target.** Defer. Originated with Contour, adopted narrowly, and current
research describes activity as stalled — testing across ~35 terminals found
grapheme-aware implementations rarely diverge from a simple 2-cell cap, and
Kitty has since proposed a superseding "text-sizing protocol" (C19) rather
than committing further to 2027.

**Why it matters.** `Contour` · `~10 others, narrow`. Worth tracking because
rusty_term's grapheme-clustering foundation means adding the mode later is
cheap — but building it now risks standardizing on the losing approach.

**Size** M · **Deps** none technically, but sequencing-wise: wait for the
field to converge.

### C19 — Text-sizing protocol (OSC 66)
**Current.** Not implemented; no per-cluster cell-width override exists in
the grid model.

**Target.** Defer for now. Kitty's protocol lets an app explicitly declare
how many cells a glyph cluster occupies — aimed at correctly rendering
complex scripts (Malayalam, Arabic, Devanagari). Even Ghostty has only
landed the OSC parser, with cell-association and rendering still open.

**Why it matters.** `kitty (originated)` · `Ghostty (parser only, 2026)`.
The right long-term answer to a real problem, but too early to build
against a settled reference implementation.

**Size** L · **Deps** meaningful complex-script rendering also needs a
HarfBuzz-equivalent shaping step rusty_term doesn't have outside the GUI
ligature shaper — and overlaps C25's territory.

---

## Tier 6 — Architecture & long-tail completeness

Lower urgency for different reasons — C20 is a genuine differentiation
opportunity nobody in the field has claimed; C21 and C22 are legacy VT/
ECMA-48 completeness with a small, real user base.

### C20 — Accessibility (screen readers / assistive tech)
**Current.** No accessibility integration in the native GUI backend;
current research turned up no evidence that kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty, or
Ghostty have meaningful screen-reader support either.

**Target.** Wire winit's accessibility tree (via `accesskit`, already a
known gap the wider Rust-terminal ecosystem shares per rusty_term's own
synthesis doc) to expose the visible screen and cursor position to
assistive technology.

**Why it matters.** Not a catch-up item — an open opportunity. Every
competitor researched shares this gap, so shipping even partial support
would be a genuine differentiator rather than table stakes.

**Size** L · **Deps** `gui` feature; `accesskit` integration with winit.

### C21 — Rectangular-area operations (DECCRA / DECFRA / DECERA)
**Current.** VT420 rectangular copy/fill/erase operations are cataloged in
rusty_term's own spec-tree reference but not implemented; no matches in
`src/`.

**Target.** Add the three operations to `Grid`: copy a rectangular cell
region (DECCRA), fill one with a character (DECFRA), erase one (DECERA).

**Why it matters.** Occasionally used by TUI apps for fast full-pane
operations. Included for ECMA-48/VT420 completeness rather than
competitive pressure.

**Size** S–M · **Deps** none.

### C22 — ECMA-48 Line/New Line mode (LNM, mode 20)
**Current.** rusty_term implements IRM (insert/replace mode) but none of
ECMA-48's other ANSI (non-DEC-private) modes — GATM, KAM, CRM, SRM, VEM,
HEM, PUM, FEAM, FETM, MATM, TTM, SATM, TSM, EBM, LNM — are handled.

**Target.** Implement LNM specifically (whether a bare LF also performs a
CR); treat the rest of the family as intentionally out of scope — they're
vestigial even in xterm's own implementation.

**Why it matters.** The smallest-value item on the whole list. LNM
specifically has occasionally-relied-upon behavior some legacy
line-oriented tools assume, unlike its siblings.

**Size** S · **Deps** none.

---

## Tier 7 — OS-interface internals

Async I/O backend depth, not user-facing capability — these change how
rusty_term talks to the kernel, not what it can display. Both explicitly
named `[ ]` in the repo's own `implementation-status.md`. They compete on
throughput/latency under heavy I/O, not on features.

### C23 — io_uring backend (Linux)
**Current.** rusty_term's Unix runtime uses tokio's `AsyncFd`/epoll path
uniformly; `implementation-status.md` marks io_uring `[ ]`.

**Target.** An io_uring-backed reactor as an alternative to `AsyncFd` on
Linux, for lower syscall overhead under high-throughput output.

**Why it matters.** `kitty (explored)`. Real but marginal for interactive
use — most terminal I/O is nowhere near syscall-bound.

**Size** L · **Deps** Linux-only; would need to coexist with the existing
`AsyncFd` path for portability to macOS/*BSD.

### C24 — IOCP-native async (Windows)
**Current.** The Windows runtime bridges ConPTY's blocking pipes into
tokio channels via dedicated threads rather than using IOCP directly;
`implementation-status.md` marks this `[ ]`.

**Target.** An IOCP-native I/O path replacing the thread-bridging approach.

**Why it matters.** Would reduce thread overhead on Windows under heavy
output; the current thread-bridge approach is simple and already proven to
work (verified on Windows 11), so this is a performance refinement, not a
correctness fix.

**Size** L · **Deps** Windows-only.

---

## Tier 8 — Internationalization

One item, sized honestly — big enough that it deserves its own scoping pass
rather than a slot in a sprint alongside seven other things.

### C25 — Bidirectional text + Unicode normalization
**Current.** No `unicode-bidi` or `unicode-normalization` crate in the
dependency tree; explicitly flagged absent in `implementation-status.md`
("Bidi/normalization... explicitly out"). rusty_term's UAX #29 grapheme
clustering handles emoji/combining marks correctly but not right-to-left
script layout (Arabic, Hebrew) or canonical normalization (NFC/NFD).

**Target.** UAX #9 bidirectional algorithm for RTL script layout, plus NFC
normalization at the grapheme-cluster boundary for search/selection
correctness. Large enough to want its own design pass — the grid's
cell-layout model assumes strict left-to-right column order throughout, and
bidi genuinely breaks that assumption.

**Why it matters.** A real, if less common, correctness requirement
(Arabic/Hebrew shells, filenames, LLM output in RTL languages). Not urgent
competitively — most researched terminals have partial-at-best RTL support
too — but the single largest deferred item across this entire assessment.

**Size** XL · **Deps** none technically, but touches the grid's
cell-layout model broadly enough to warrant its own scoping pass; overlaps
C19's complex-script-shaping territory.

---

## Tier 9 — L13 protocol depth (no external comparison)

These extend rusty_term's own invention. No other terminal has an
MCP/LSP/ACP side-channel to compare adoption against, so the "who else has
this" lens that drives every other tier doesn't apply. Listed because the
repo's own docs flag them as intentional long-tail, not because of
competitive pressure.

### C26 — DAP / Jupyter protocol bridges
**Current.** L13 speaks `channel`/`mcp`/`lsp`/`acp`/`render`. DAP (Debug
Adapter Protocol) and the Jupyter kernel protocol are named in the repo's
own docs as intentional long-tail items, not implemented.

**Target.** Additional sub-protocol tags under the same OSC 5379 transport,
following the initialize-negotiation pattern already established for
`lsp`/`acp` in `l13/src/lib.rs`.

**Why it matters.** Would let a debugger or notebook kernel running inside
rusty_term expose itself the same way MCP tools do today. Speculative value
until a concrete client exists that wants it.

**Size** L · **Deps** `l13` feature; the `rusty_term_l13` crate's
`TerminalState` trait boundary.

### C27 — Full LSP/ACP backends behind the existing negotiation endpoints
**Current.** The `lsp` and `acp` sub-protocols implement only the
`initialize` handshake, correctly advertising empty capabilities since "a
terminal has no language/agent backend of its own" (`l13/src/lib.rs`).

**Target.** An actual backend behind one or both endpoints — e.g.
registering `rusty_lsp`'s own `Server` so rusty_term speaks real LSP
methods, not just negotiates them.

**Why it matters.** Turns a protocol stub into a working feature, but it's
unclear what the terminal itself would be a language server *for* — closer
to "close the loop for completeness" than a felt need from any known
client.

**Size** L · **Deps** `l13` feature; would pull in more of `rusty_lsp`'s
surface than the JSON-RPC/type layer currently used.

---

## Considered and rejected

### R01 — Alternate-screen resize reflow
**Considered.** Whether the alternate screen should get the same
wrap-aware reflow the primary screen has (`Grid::resize` →
`reflow_history`), instead of being clipped/extended on resize as it is
today.

**Verdict: not recommended.** Full-screen apps (vim, htop, less) own their
own repaint on `SIGWINCH` and don't expect the terminal to preserve
alt-screen content across a resize the way scrollback does — xterm, kitty,
and Alacritty all treat the alt screen the same clipped way rusty_term
already does. Included so the audit shows its work: this was checked, not
missed.

---

## Suggested sequencing

Cheapest wins that unblock the next wave, most-requested first. Tiers 7–9
and the watch-list items in Tier 5 aren't sequenced — pull any forward
opportunistically; none block anything else here.

| Wave | Items | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | C01, C04, C05, C07 | Cheapest, most self-contained protocol wins — sync output, OSC 22, title stack, pixel-size queries. No dependencies between them; parallelizable. |
| 2 | C02, C06 | Undercurl is the highest-value remaining Tier 1 item; DECRQM benefits from C01 already existing to report on. |
| 3 | C10, C11, C03 | Native-GUI input parity, ending with the larger Kitty-keyboard-protocol lift once the smaller input fixes are out of the way. |
| 4 | C15, C16, C17 | Shell-integration extensions that build directly on OSC 133 infrastructure already in place. |
| 5 | C14, C13 | Window-model work — opacity first (contained), multi-window second (touches the App/EventLoop lifecycle). |
| 6 | C08, C09, C12 | GPU/CPU render-path parity, batched together — C08/C09 gated on the multi-cell-quad pipeline, C12 independent but thematically adjacent. |
| 7 | C22, C21 | Cheap legacy-completeness cleanup once everything with real user impact is done. |
| — | C18, C19, C20, C23, C24, C25, C26, C27 | Not sequenced. C18/C19 are watch-and-wait (protocol churn); C20 is a standalone differentiation bet; C23/C24 are performance-only refinements; C25 needs its own scoping pass before it can be sequenced at all; C26/C27 are speculative L13 depth with no known client asking for them yet. |
